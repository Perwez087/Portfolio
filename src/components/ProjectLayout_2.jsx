Utilize a <div> or <section> for the thumbnails section to showcase different aspects of the marketing services. Tailwind CSS can be used for quick styling with classes for layout, typography, and colors. Ensure the design is fully responsive, with the navigation bar and hero section adjusting well on different screen sizes. Tailwindâ€™s responsive classes will be useful here. Consider using JavaScript to add interactivity, like toggling the mobile menu or animating elements on scroll.Libraries like AOS (Animate On Scroll) can be used to introduce subtle animations to the text and images as they enter the viewport."
